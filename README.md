# SocialMediaSite

Hello reader,

This is the Social Media Website I'm working on as a side project. I spend a few hours a week
working on this.

This is not deployed as of now. There is still a lot of work that needs to get done
before I can deploy it. 

If you'd like to preview, clone the repository and run
`python manage.py runserver`

Right now, I have a working authorization system and friend system, where users can send, 
recieve and accept friend requests. I am currently working on the live messaging feature,
which uses websocket to send real-time messages.

Let me know if you have any questions.
