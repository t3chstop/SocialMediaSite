# SocialMediaSite
I am currently working on a social media site built on django. It will take me a while to get everything working and host it. Also, the name is temporary until I can think of a better one.

I work very slowly, especially because I am very new so changes won't come very often. I am priding myself in writing all the code myself, meaning I am not copying from tutorials, although
I am taking guidance in how to do things. If you are interested in contributing, feel free to fork the repository and submit a PR, although its likely a waste of your time. If you
have questions let me know by contacting me on discord t3chstop#6969
